This Is (Not) A Readme (Yet)
============================

Maybe something will be made of this project. Maybe not. It's my hope
that it doesn't turn into that [other project](https://github.com/Iambian/VANISH) that both never got anywhere and was named specifically
so that it'd reflect its true nature of having gotten nowhere.
After all, acetone is a thing used to make messes go away...

Here's hoping it in itself doesn't do that.

Progress
--------
* Core filled out with official instructions. SOME TESTED.
* Opcode disassembler with all known instructions. SOME TESTED. PROBABLY WORKS.
* Memory can now be mapped to RAM or ROM. Sort of. No hardware
* Test rig set up to map memory to a character display.
