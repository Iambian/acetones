This Is (Not) A Readme (Yet)
============================

Maybe something will be made of this project. Maybe not. It's my hope
that it doesn't turn into that [other project](https://github.com/Iambian/VANISH) that both never got anywhere and was named specifically
so that it'd reflect its true nature of having gotten nowhere.
After all, acetone is a thing used to make messes go away...

Here's hoping it in itself doesn't do that.
